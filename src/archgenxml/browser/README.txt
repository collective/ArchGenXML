View classes
============

This directory holds the view classes for the main templates. Main
templates mostly create python modules ('__init__.py', 'myclass.py'),
but also files like 'configure.zcml'.

There is a separate directory 'snippets' that holds view classes for
small individual pieces of code, like for module headers or for
individual workflow steps or so.
