This branch targets at Plone 2.5 and 3.0. It gets a huge cleanup.

We will take the chainsaw and remove much of the BBB code!!!

You'll need refactoring of custom parts such as AppInstall.py
if you migrate your product using archgenxml 2.0.

To generate code for Plone 2.5 you need to set the tagged value
'plone_target_version' on model level to '2.5' (defaults to '3.0').
