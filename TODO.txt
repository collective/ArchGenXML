TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

To-do list for current HEAD code, not a feature wish list. 
A list of wished-for/planned features planned is at:
http://plone.org/development/teams/developer/ArchGenXML

* Finish writing documentation: current is a tutorial at plone.org

	- optilude and natoka want to help :)
	
	- need to grep source code for stereotype and TGV checks and document
	   each one. Also need to classify which ones are in 1.2 and which ones
	   are only in trunk.

* New <<ordered>> stereotype on folderish items allows using OrderedBaseFolder:
  
    - What impact does this have on I18NBaseFolder use (I can't find it in
        Products/Archetypes...)
        
    - elvix seems to think we shouldn't generate this as all, since LinguaPlone
        supercedes i18nlayer, and I18NBaseFolder was a workaround for a 
        weakness in i18nlayer. I can't answer to that, since I've not used
        either.

* Move remainder of templates in templates/ to DTML 

    - action_view.pt
    - apeconf_folder.xml
    - apeconf_object.xml
    - generated.pot
    - portlet_template.pt

* Move class, interface generation to DTML. There are too many conditionals and
    strings being generated in the current code. :-) Having DTML conditionals
    and loops would make it much clearer and easier to manipulate. 
    
* Tool support:
  automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like base_view, metadata 
  and maybe references) on classes with stereotype 'portal_tool'
    
* ATVocabularyManager integration, part registration of class:
  fetch container_class - needs to be refined:
  check if parent has vocabulary_container_stereotype and use its 
  name as container
  else check for TGV vocabulary_container
  fallback: use SimpleVocabulary

* On Workflow definitions generation

  * Define how worklists would be represented using state diagrams

  * Define custom initial state using a tagged value mark (to enable the correct 
    generation of initial state on workflow definitions, when the initial state 
    is not the first state created on the model.) 

      jensens: i think this is solved, using the UML-initial-state-symbol (solid circle).
      
      xiru: it is already supported using a tagged valued called initial_state on the 
      state definition. However, support the UML initial state symbol would be ok too.

  * Test the transitions scripts generation

      xiru: It is already supported, but the code is a bit ugly yet.

  * Add support for conditions on transitions

      xiru: It is already supported too, but not documented :-P

* Write documentation about workflow generation features (I think that only xiru knows all these features)
  Jensens: I created a sample model: InExWorkflow in collective CVS

* Update README
