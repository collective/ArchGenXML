TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

this are todos for current HEAD code, not a feature wish list. 
A list of iwished/plannedi features planned is at:
http://plone.org/development/teams/developer/ArchGenXML

* finish writing documentation for 1.1

* ATVocabularyManager integration, part registration of class:
  fetch container_class - needs to be refined:
  check if parent has vocabulary_container_stereotype and use its 
  name as container
  else check for TGV vocabulary_container
  fallback: use SimpleVocabulary

* Tool support:
  automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like base_view, metadata 
  and maybe references) on classes with stereotype 'portal_tool'

* On Workflow definitions generation

  * Define how worklists would be represented using state diagrams

  * Define custom initial state using a tagged value mark (to enable the correct generation of initial state on workflow definitions, when the initial state is not the first state created on the model.)

  * Test the transitions scripts generation

  * Add support for conditions on transitions

* Write documentation about workflow generation features (I think that only xiru knows all these features)

* Update README
