TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

To-do list for current HEAD code, not a feature wish list. 
A list of wished-for/planned features planned is at:
http://plone.org/development/teams/developer/ArchGenXML

* BUG: Manually created methods lose security declarations upon re-generation!
* BUG: Method that end with a comma-newline-value lose that value. For example:
    
            return (value1,
                    value2)
  If this is the end of a method, the line with "value2)" is lost.
    
* Creation permissions:

    - tagged value creation_permission (string or python:) on class
    - use Bricolite method for registering custom permissions
    
* Workflow

    - tagged value workflow on class sets workflow by name, allow empty for none
    
* Initialise uml_profile with all tagged values + steretypes + documentation

    - See stereotype_reference.stx, tgv_reference.stx

    - Make getTaggedValue() and hasStereotype() fail if the tagged 
        value/stereotype is not registered in a profile to force them all
        to be documented

* When generating docstrings, be more clever about linebreaks and whitespace. 

	- Poseidon does not wrap, so we need to support funny linebreaks.

* New <<ordered>> stereotype on folderish items allows using OrderedBaseFolder:
  
    - What impact does this have on I18NBaseFolder use (I can't find it in
        Products/Archetypes...)
        
    - elvix seems to think we shouldn't generate this as all, since LinguaPlone
        supercedes i18nlayer, and I18NBaseFolder was a workaround for a 
        weakness in i18nlayer. I can't answer to that, since I've not used
        either.

* Move remainder of templates in templates/ to DTML 

    - action_view.pt
    - apeconf_folder.xml
    - apeconf_object.xml
    - generated.pot
    - portlet_template.pt

* Move class, interface generation to DTML. There are too many conditionals and
    strings being generated in the current code. :-) Having DTML conditionals
    and loops would make it much clearer and easier to manipulate. 
    
* Tool support:
  automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like base_view, metadata 
  and maybe references) on classes with stereotype 'portal_tool'. Must be
  possible to explicitly enable them again.
    
* ATVocabularyManager integration, part registration of class:
  fetch container_class - needs to be refined:
  check if parent has vocabulary_container_stereotype and use its 
  name as container
  else check for TGV vocabulary_container
  fallback: use SimpleVocabulary

* Define how worklists would be represented using state diagrams and implement
