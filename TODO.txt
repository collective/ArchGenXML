TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

this are todos for current HEAD code, not a feature wish list. 
A list of iwished/plannedi features planned is at:
http://plone.org/development/teams/developer/ArchGenXML

* finish writing documentation: current is a tutorial at plone.org!

* ATVocabularyManager integration, part registration of class:
  fetch container_class - needs to be refined:
  check if parent has vocabulary_container_stereotype and use its 
  name as container
  else check for TGV vocabulary_container
  fallback: use SimpleVocabulary

* Tool support:
  automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like base_view, metadata 
  and maybe references) on classes with stereotype 'portal_tool'

* On Workflow definitions generation

  * Define how worklists would be represented using state diagrams

  * Define custom initial state using a tagged value mark (to enable the correct 
    generation of initial state on workflow definitions, when the initial state 
    is not the first state created on the model.) 

      jensens: i think this is solved, using the UML-initial-state-symbol (solid circle).
      
      xiru: it is already supported using a tagged valued called initial_state on the 
      state definition. However, support the UML initial state symbol would be ok too.

  * Test the transitions scripts generation

      xiru: It is already supported, but the code is a bit ugly yet.

  * Add support for conditions on transitions

      xiru: It is already supported too, but not documented :-P

* Write documentation about workflow generation features (I think that only xiru knows all these features)
  Jensens: I created a sample model: InExWorkflow in collective CVS

* Update README
