This file should be fed to the ArgoUML profile settings to make it aware of the Plone-related stereotypes, tagged values, etc.

Put the path to this file in this location in ArgoUML:

Edit -> Settings -> Preferences -> Profile File

argouml_profle.xmi is the old profile used with archgenxml <= 1.5.2.

Please use archgenxml_profile.xmi to have the latest stereotypes and tagged-values.
You should use this one if you use ArgoUML >= 0.26 if you don't want to have problems updating the profile in the future.
