       hates copy and paste and loves code generation, he made a 
       great documentation and buzzes Phil to bring in new features.
       He added tool support and control panel integration,
       automatic msgid/pot generation with i18ndude integration,
       module-info-header support and config-file support,
       cmfmember support and several other little fixes and features.

    Fabiano Weimar dos Santos (xiru) --
       brought in some good ideas from his project (UML2AT). He did lots of 
       testing and bug fixing and more bugfixing. Fabiano is our workflow 
       hero: He wrote several code generation improvements for workflow 
       definition.
