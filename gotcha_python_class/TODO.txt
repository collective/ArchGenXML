TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

To-do list for current HEAD code, not a feature wish list. 
A list of wished-for/planned features planned is at:
http://plone.org/development/teams/developer/ArchGenXML

* BUG: Method that end with a comma-newline-value lose that value. For example:
    
            return (value1,
                    value2)
  If this is the end of a method, the line with "value2)" is lost.
  There is a (failing) unittest for this.
    
* Creation permissions:

    - tagged value creation_permission (string or python:) on class
    - use Bricolite method for registering custom permissions

    Note: look at the --help output, some of the options changed
    names. Also: you now have to pass in 'Add portal content' or so
    instead of just 'portal'. 
    
* Initialise uml_profile with all tagged values + steretypes + documentation

    [x] tagged values are now in TaggedValueSupport. Nicely
    documented, too. Missing TGVs give a warning, it doesn't break off
    the processing.

    [x] Do the same for stereotypes. They're grouped together already,
    so this shouldn't be much work.

* When generating docstrings, be more clever about linebreaks and whitespace. 

	- Poseidon does not wrap, so we need to support funny linebreaks.

* Move remainder of templates in templates/ to DTML 

    - action_view.pt
    - apeconf_folder.xml
    - apeconf_object.xml
    - generated.pot
    - portlet_template.pt

* stereotype <<portlet>> does not work, but <<portlet_view>> does. Documentation 
  points to portlet. Tagged value autoinstall is registered for <<portlet>> only.
  Here a clean up is needed. 

* portlet sample code is Plone 2.0.x style and doenst work with Plone 2.1. 

* Move class, interface generation to DTML. There are too many conditionals and
    strings being generated in the current code. :-) Having DTML conditionals
    and loops would make it much clearer and easier to manipulate. 
    
* Tool support:
  automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like base_view, metadata 
  and maybe references) on classes with stereotype 'portal_tool'. Must be
  possible to explicitly enable them again.
    
* ATVocabularyManager integration, part registration of class:
  fetch container_class - needs to be refined:
  check if parent has vocabulary_container_stereotype and use its 
  name as container
  else check for TGV vocabulary_container
  fallback: use SimpleVocabulary

[x] Define how worklists would be represented using state diagrams and
implement

[ ] Add a.a.p. makefile including checker for XXX, TBD codes (=>Reinout)

[ ] Also group together the generateable documentation in that aap
makefile and send it off to the documentation area on plone.org to
keep it current.

[ ] Longer term: add defaults to the tagged values.

[ ] Changed negative tagged values to positive ones with 
    default = True. (Tip from optilude).

[ ] Add BrowserDefault/ new style FTI support (Plone 2.1 et al style)
