Installing archgenxml 
=====================

Using buildout
--------------

Put a bootstrap.py_ into a fresh directory, copy the following snippet into a 
new file `buildout.cfg`::

    [buildout]
    parts = 
        archgenxml
        
    [archgenxml]
    recipe = repoze.recipe.egg:scripts
    eggs =
        archgenxml [i18n]

.. _bootstrap.py: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
and run::

    $ python bootstrap.py 
    $ ./bin/buildout    

archgenxml is now available in `./bin/archgenxml` 

From the cheeseshop
-------------------

``easy_install archgenxml``, so the usual. 

Attention, your pythons site-packages are polluted with zope3-stuff. See below:
`Zope Dependencies`.

You should install it in a virtualenv like this::

    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages agx
    $ cd agx/
    $ source bin/activate
    $ easy_install archgenxml


SVN directories - what is stable, what is not?
----------------------------------------------

ArchGenXML's svn trunk has been changed to be the 2.x development
version. 

As usual, the goal is to keep trunk workable. Some of the developers
work and develop on the edge: trunk. 

If you need stability, use the latest release.


Installing trunk
----------------

With 1.6, we switched to using setuptools. With 2.2 we switched to use 
buildout. For trunk development use the buildout at 

https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/ArchGenXML/buildout

Zope Dependencies
-----------------

ArchGenXML has a dependency on some zope3 machinery. That messes up other 
zopes that use the same python version. So using buildout is recommended!

Dependencies are: xmiparser, zope.interface, zope.component and zope.documenttemplate, stripogram.

On Windows
----------
On Windows, you have to install and configure the `mingw32 compiler`_ to install zope.proxy.
