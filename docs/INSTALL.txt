Installing archgenxml 
=====================

From the cheeseshop
-------------------

``easy_install archgenxml``, so the usual. 

Attention, your pythons site-packages are polluted with zope3-stuff. 

Using buildout
--------------

Put a bootstrap.py_ into a fresh directory, copy the following snippet into a 
new file `buildout.cfg`::

    [buildout]
    parts = 
        archgenxml
        
    [archgenxml]
    recipe = repoze.recipe.egg:scripts
    eggs =
        archgenxml [i18n]

.. _bootstrap.py: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
and run::

    $ python bootstrap.py 
    $./bin/buildout    

archgenxml is now available in `./bin/archgenxml` 


From tgz
--------

To install it use the --no-compile option for now. We need to figure out how
to exclude dtml-files ending with .py from byte-compiling at install time.::

  $ python setup.py install --no-compile


At Debian based systems
-----------------------

*untested* with 2.2 release!

To build a Debian Package run::

  $ fakeroot debian/rules binary
  
and install the *.deb file as usal.



SVN directories - what is stable, what is not?
----------------------------------------------

ArchGenXML's svn trunk has been changed to be the 2.x development
version. 

As usual, the goal is to keep trunk workable. Some of the developers
work and develop on the edge: trunk. 

If you need stability, use the latest release.

Major changes in 2.0
--------------------

We updated ArchGenXML and changed tons of things to get modernized generated
code.

As a warning: Using an old model with ArchGenXML 2.0 creates some work. This
specially if you ave lots of logic in AppInstall.py or custom workflow scripts. 
You need to migrate such code manually.


Installing trunk
----------------

With 1.6, we switched to using setuptools. With 2.2 we switched to use 
buildout. For trunk development use the buildout at 

https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/ArchGenXML/buildout

Zope Dependencies
-----------------

ArchGenXML has a dependency on some zope3 machinery. That messes up other 
zopes that use the same python version. So using buildout is recommended!

Dependencies are: zope.interface, zope.component and zope.configuration.
