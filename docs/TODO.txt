TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

* configlet installation is missing, a sample controlpanel.xml is already there, 
  need to wire in

* generate pot file into "locales", instead i18n, keep some BBB, so if 
  folder i18n exists take it. offer a sync script.

* remove workflowscript generation, generate event subscribers instead
  for plone2.5 target version a patch exists and is generated
  subscriber geneartion started, non-trivial thing!

* make setuptools or at least debian copy umltools/argouml/argouml_profile.xmi
  to /usr/share/archgenxml

* update docs/manual/*registry* and check quickref

* sync docs/manual with online manual (=master) at plone.org

* importGSDependencies - some more research on how to filter the import steps
  by profile and how to define an import step as the very first executed one.
  (After Plone Conference and talking with several people this might be solved 
  in a future release of GS)

* refactor generateFieldMoves machinery. does not consider copied fields atm!
  (no one used this until now??)

* atm only the default actions are taken for generation

* move STATE_PERMISSION_MAPPING out of TaggedValueSupport and
  move the conversion of permission-short cuts over to the 
  WorkflowGenerator.

* write an import step adding inherited allowed types

* tgv "hide_actions" need to get respect in types.xml (deprecated: use stereotype
  <<noaction>>

* BUG: Method that end with a comma-newline-value lose that value. For example:

            return (value1,
                    value2)
  If this is the end of a method, the line with "value2)" is lost.
  There is a (failing) unittest for this.
  Workaround: add a 'pass' as last statement in method.

* When generating docstrings, be more clever about linebreaks and whitespace.

    - Poseidon does not wrap, so we need to support funny linebreaks.

* Move remainder of templates in templates/ to DTML

* Move class, interface generation to DTML. There are too many
  conditionals and strings being generated in the current code. :-)
  Having DTML conditionals and loops would make it much clearer and
  easier to manipulate.

* Tool support: automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like
  base_view, metadata and maybe references) on classes with stereotype
  'portal_tool'. Must be possible to explicitly enable them again.

* Also group together the generateable documentation in one script so
  that it is easy to update the documentation area on plone.org to
  keep it current.

* Longer term: add defaults to the tagged values.

* Allow python package products instead of zope products.

* Support plone 3.0 portlets.

* Support plone 3.0 viewlets (replacement of many included macros).
