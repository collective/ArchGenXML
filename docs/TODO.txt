TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

* add worklist and workflow trigger support (missing).

* generate pot file into "locales", instead i18n, keep some BBB, so if 
  folder i18n exists take it. offer a sync script.

* make setuptools or at least debian copy umltools/argouml/argouml_profile.xmi
  to /usr/share/archgenxml

* update docs/manual/*registry* and check quickref

* sync docs/manual with online manual (=master) at plone.org

* refactor generateFieldMoves machinery. does not consider copied fields atm!
  (no one used this until now??)

* write an import step adding inherited allowed types

* BUG: Method that end with a comma-newline-value lose that value. For example:

            return (value1,
                    value2)
  If this is the end of a method, the line with "value2)" is lost.
  There is a (failing) unittest for this.
  Workaround: add a 'pass' as last statement in method.

* When generating docstrings, be more clever about linebreaks and whitespace.

    - Poseidon does not wrap, so we need to support funny linebreaks.

* Move remainder of templates in templates/ to DTML

* Move class, interface generation to DTML. There are too many
  conditionals and strings being generated in the current code. :-)
  Having DTML conditionals and loops would make it much clearer and
  easier to manipulate.

* Tool support: automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like
  base_view, metadata and maybe references) on classes with stereotype
  'portal_tool'. Must be possible to explicitly enable them again.

* group together the generateable documentation in one script so
  that it is easy to update the documentation area on plone.org to
  keep it current.

* Longer term: add defaults to the tagged values.

* Allow python package products instead of zope products.

* Support plone 3.0 viewlets (replacement of many included macros).
