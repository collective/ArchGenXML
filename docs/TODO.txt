TODO's for ArchGenXML
---------------------

* atm only the default actions are taken for generation

* move STATE_PERMISSION_MAPPING out of TaggedValueSupport and
  move the conversion of permission-short cuts over to the 
  WorkflowGenerator.

* write a import step adding inherited allowed types

* tgv "hide_actions" need to get respect in types.xml 

* BUG: Method that end with a comma-newline-value lose that value. For example:

            return (value1,
                    value2)
  If this is the end of a method, the line with "value2)" is lost.
  There is a (failing) unittest for this.
  Workaround: add a 'pass' as last statement in method.

* When generating docstrings, be more clever about linebreaks and whitespace.

    - Poseidon does not wrap, so we need to support funny linebreaks.

* Move remainder of templates in templates/ to DTML

    - action_view.pt
    - generated.pot
    - portlet_template.pt

* Move class, interface generation to DTML. There are too many
  conditionals and strings being generated in the current code. :-)
  Having DTML conditionals and loops would make it much clearer and
  easier to manipulate.

* Tool support: automagically disable uneccessary tabs (like
  base_view, metadata and maybe references) on classes with stereotype
  'portal_tool'. Must be possible to explicitly enable them again.

* Also group together the generateable documentation in one script so
  that it is easy to update the documentation area on plone.org to
  keep it current.

* Longer term: add defaults to the tagged values.

* Allow python package products instead of zope products.

* Empty out install.py in favour of genericsetup. (almost done)

* Support plone 3.0 portlets.

* Support plone 3.0 viewlets (replacement of many included macros).

* Perhaps look at new 3.0 editor role.

* Move index and brain generation from archetypes fields to
  catalog.xml.
