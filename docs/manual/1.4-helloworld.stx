title: Hello World
description: Create your first content type with ArchGenXML
Content-Type: text/structured

Open the UML tool of your choice. Make a new UML model and give it a name 
'HelloWorld'. Then add a class diagram (most UML tools do this automatically). 

Choose the tool for class creation and add a class to the diagram. Give it a 
name such as "HelloType" and add an attribute 'HelloText' with type 
'String'. The "helloworld.zargo":helloworld.zargo was created with ArgoUML 
and contains the type as described above.

Generating the product

 Save/export your model as an XMI file with the name MyFirstExample.xmi (or in 
 an XMI-container format like .uml, .zargo or .zuml). Then go to the command line 
 and execute::

  $ archgenxml helloworld.zargo

 ArchGenXML will begin code generation. When it completes, you will have a new 
 folder 'HelloWorld' on your file system. Its contents looks like::

  HelloWorld/

Installing and using the generated product

 Move the whole folder 'HelloWorld' to your Zope instance's 'Products' 
 folder. Restart  Zope, open Plone in a browser and log in as Manager. Choose 
 'Plone Setup' from the personal bar and choose 'Add/Remove Products'. A new 
 product 'HelloWordl' should now appear in the list of products
 available for install. Choose it and click 'install'. Go to your personal 
 folder. In the list of addable items you'll find the new product as an 
 addable content type. Add a test instance to see if it works.
