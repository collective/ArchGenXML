title: Make ArgoUML provide tagged values and stereotypes in dropdown menus
description: ArgoUML can load a "definition" file with predefined tagged values 
and stereotypes. So you have all the custom tagged values and stereotypes used 
by a ArchGenXML available in dropdown menus.
Content-Type: text/structured

Background and Notes

 The screenshot below shows ArgoUML with the custom tags from the definition 
 file. Having many of the possible options available from a menu has the 
 following benefits:
 
 * saves time - sometimes clicking is faster  than typing

 * reduces errors - no more mispelled tags*
 
 * presents a learning opportunity - seeing new tags and stereotypes provides a 
   springboard for further investigation

 This walks you through how a setup of ArgoUML on an Ubuntu desktop system. The 
 methodology should be easily adjusted to other platforms.

Assumptions

 These are my assumptions:

 * You already have java (sun j2re 1.5) installed

Getting ArgoUML and the definition file

 This instructions are tested with ArgoUML v0.24

 Download and unpack the file "argouml.tigris.org":argouml.tigris.org 
 
 A good location to unpack is '/opt/ArgoUML'. It is handy to symlink 
 'argouml.sh' to '/usr/local/bin/argouml'.
 
 Download the definition file and put it into /opt/ArgoUML . If you used 
 easy_install it is not included. The tarball and the debian packages (XXX TODO)
 does include it. The tarball in the 'umltools/argouml' directory, the debian 
 package place in under '/usr/share/archgenxml' (XXX TODO) directory.
 
 The file can also be generated - useful for those using svn trunk and an 
 outdated. XXX TODO How does it work?

Launching ArgoUML with definition file

 To launch the file change to the '/opt/ArgoUML' directory and run::

  /PATH/TO/java -Dargo.defaultModel=archgenxml_profile.xmi -jar argouml-mdr.jar
  
 To simplify your life just put the line with absolute pathes into a shell 
 script 'agxargo' and run it instead. 

 User on windows OS might prefer the line (can someone test and report?)::
 
  %_JAVACMD% %ARGOUML_OPTS% -jar "%ARGO_HOME%argouml-mdr.jar" % to %_JAVACMD% -Dargo.defaultModel=ArchGenXMLprofile.xmi -jar %ARGO_HOME%argouml-mdr.jar" %
 
  
Why ArgoUML?

 Just a few notes on why using ArgoUML.
 
 * Mature - it supports the important stuff (at least as far as ArchGenXML 
   goes), state diagrams, tagged-values, stereotypes.

 * It is pretty lightweight, which is important when your laptop only has 
   256 MB of RAM and a PIII 700 Mhz processor. Poseidon Community Edition, 
   though nice, is just too memory hungry.

 * Price is good (free and open source)
