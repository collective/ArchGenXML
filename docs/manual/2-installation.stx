description: How to install ArchGenXML and get up and running.
Content-Type: text/structured

Preconditions

  * You need a working Python interpreter, version 2.4+.

  * You need Plone 2.5.3+ or Plone 3.0.1+ installed (choose the latest stable release) and its 
    dependencies to see your generated code in action. Plone 3 is supported by the 
    subversion-trunk.
    
  * You need the libraries of Zope 2.10 (or Zope 3.3) available in your system.
    ArchGenXML needs them to run, not the generated code.

  * We also recommend to upgrade Archetypes to the latest stable release, 
    preferrably latest 1.4.x, 1.5.x or later.    

Download & Installation

 The trunk is planned to be always stable, because developement is done on 
 branches. 
  
 using easy_install
  
   with "easy_install":http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall 
   configured, you can download and install ArchGenXML using the Python 
   Cheeseshop.
   
   Just type 'easy_install archgenxml'.   
   
   ArchGenXML will be installed in your Pythons library directory, a symlink to 
   the executablewill be placed into the directory your system normally would 
   expect user executeable binaries.
 
 from the tarball (*.tgz) or subversion

   You need to download the release tarball of ArchGenXML from 
   "plone.org's products section":http://plone.org/products/archgenxml. Choose 
   the most recent version or use the bleeding edge development version - best 
   choice with latest Plone Versions - from the 
   "Subversion repository":https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/ArchGenXML/trunk/.
 
   * untar 'tar xzf ArchGenXML-xx.yy.tgz' to a directory of your choice.
   
   * change into the directory 'cd ArchGenXML'
   
   * start 'python setup.py install' *or*
   
   * on Debian based systems you can build your debian package with
     'fakeroot debian/rules binary' and install the package with for example
     'dpkg -i archgenxml_2.0_i386.deb' - and remove it later - without any 
     garbage left *or*
   
   * ArchGenXML will be installed in your Pythons library directory, a symlink to 
   the executablewill be placed into the directory your system normally would 
   expect user executeable binaries.   
   
  on Debian based systems such as Debian or Ubuntu
  
   * add 'XX TODO' to your package sources, for example edit '/etc/apt/sources'
   
   * 'apt-get update'
   
   * 'apt-get install archgenxml' 
   
   * you can use for above tasks the paket-manager of your choice (such as 
     Synaptic).
     
 after installation configuration

Additional software

  To get all the features of ArchGenXML, you may need some of the following.

  For code generation:

   i18ndude -- Without this, the generation of translatable user interface 
   strings is disabled. "Instructions/ download":http://plone.org/products/i18ndude 

   Stripogram -- Some UML tools produce HTML in the documentation elements in 
   XMI. Stripogram converts them into plain text. Without having Stripogram 
   installed this feature is disabled. Download and install stripogram from the 
   "squishdot":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1083&package_id=34645 
   project on sourceforge.net.

  For running the generated code (optional)

   ATVocabularyManager -- Enables usage of custom dynamic vocabularies. 
   "Download and install the product":http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager

   Relations -- enables complex references. 
   "Download and install the product":http://plone.org/products/relations

   CompoundField -- enables usage of multiplicity on fields an definition of 
   fields as a compund of other fields. 
   "Download and install the product":http://plone.org/products/compundfield
   
   Remember -- enables contentish custom member objects. "Download and install

UML Tools

 ArchGenXML processes models stored in 
 "XMI":http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/xmi.htm. This XML format 
 isn't intended to be written in a plain text editor nor in a tree based XML 
 editor, so you will almost certainly use a UML design tool. Below is a more or 
 less complete list of such tools. If you know about any others tools missing 
 from this list, have more detailed information or have experience with a tool 
 in combination with ArchGenXML, please write the author a short e-mail.

ArgoUML -- Website and download: "argouml.tigris.org":http://argouml.tigris.org/

 Read "Using ArgoUML with ArchGenXML":http://plone.org/products/archgenxml/documentation/how-to/using-argouml-model-with-archgenxml-data-types-stereotypes-and-tagged-values.

 * Free software 

 * Written in Java

 * Runs on most platforms

 * Stores the model natively as XMI + diagram information in .xmi, .uml. or 
   .zargo files (ziped .uml files).

 * No 'undo' (planned for future)

 * Some known, but non-critical bugs

Poseidon (by Gentleware) -- "Website and download":http://www.gentleware.com/, 
 
 * Commercial software - so called Community Editionfor low-cost license 
   available, supports XMI version 1.2

 * Written in Java, runs on most platforms

 * commercial fork of ArgoUML (theres no synchronisation between projects)

 * Stores the model natively as XMI + diagram information in .zuml files (zip files)

 * Is very slow and needs lots of memory and a fast CPU

ObjectDomain -- Website and download: "objectdomain.com":http://objectdomain.com/

 * Commercial, free time-limited demo for <= 30 classes

 * Written in Java

 * Runs on most platforms

 * Need to export model from proprietary .odm format to .xmi

Powerdesigner (by Sybase) -- Website and download: "sybase.com":http://www.sybase.com/

 * XMI version 1.1

 * Need to export model to xmi

Umbrello (KDE) -- Website and download: "uml.sourceforge.net":http://uml.sourceforge.net/

 * Free software

 * Runs under Linux/KDE

 * Stores the model natively as XMI

 * At the time of testing (somewhere in the first half of 2004), Umbrello wasn't 
 complete and the XMI not 100% standards compliant. Umbrello 
 "promises":http://uml.sourceforge.net/feature.php to support XMI correctly on 
 version 1.4, which will be shipped with KDE 3.4. (please report your experience).
