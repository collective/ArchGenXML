Authors

  Philipp Auersperg (phil@bluedynamics.com)

    Phil was the original author of the product. He says he had to
    start this project because he is too lazy for coding. He added
    tons of features and core functionality. He is the l'Ã©minence grise 
    maintainer.

  Jens Klein (jens@bluedynamics.com)

    Jens hates copy and paste and loves code generation. He is ArchGenXML
    developer from the beginning, did much of the documentation, refactored
    several parts and added tons of features. He is the release manager.

  Reinout van Rees

    Reinout did lots of cleanup and added documentation features. He
    started the 1.6 development branch (now trunk) and moved
    archgenxml to setuptools. He is the co release manager.

  Martin Aspeli (optilude)

    Improvements and important cleanups, documentation.

  Fabiano Weimar dos Santos (xiru)

    Fabiano brought in some good ideas from his project (UML2AT). He
    did lots of testing and bug fixing and more bugfixing. Fabiano is
    our workflow hero: He wrote several code generation improvements
    for workflow definition.

  Joel Burton (joel@joelburton.com)

    Joel rewrote the option handling system to use optparse, and
    worked on the product documentation.

    Dorneles cleaned up the license/licence mess and killed the
    undesired whitespaces generation.
