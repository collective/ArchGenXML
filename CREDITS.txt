Authors

  Philipp Auersperg (phil@bluedynamics.com)

    Phil was the original author of the product. He says he had to
    start this project because he is too lazy for coding. He added
    tons of features and core functionality

  Jens Klein (jens@bluedynamics.com)

    Jens hates copy and paste and loves code generation. He created
    much of the documentation and new features, like tool and control
    panel integration, automatic msgid/pot generation with i18ndude,
    module-info-header support and config-file support, CMFMember support
    and several other little fixes and features.

  Reinout van Rees

    Reinout did lots of cleanup and added documentation features. He
    started the 1.6 development branch (now trunk) and moved
    archgenxml to setuptools.

  Martin Aspeli (optilude)

    Improvements and important cleanups, documentation.

  Fabiano Weimar dos Santos (xiru)

    Fabiano brought in some good ideas from his project (UML2AT). He
    did lots of testing and bug fixing and more bugfixing. Fabiano is
    our workflow hero: He wrote several code generation improvements
    for workflow definition.

  Joel Burton (joel@joelburton.com)

    Joel rewrote the option handling system to use optparse, and
    worked on the product documentation.

  Dorneles Tremea (deo)

    Dorneles cleaned up the license/licence mess and killed the
    undesired whitespaces generation.

  Jean Rodrigo Ferri (ferri)

    Bug killer and some tricks with workflow, portal tools, install,
    etc.
