Authors

  Philipp Auersperg (phil@bluedynamics.com)

    Phil was the original author of the product. He says he had to
    start this project because he is too lazy for coding. He added
    tons of features and core functionality

  Jens Klein (jens@bluedynamics.com)
    
    Jens hates copy and paste and loves code generation. He created  
    much of the documentation and new featuresxi, like tool and control 
    panel integration, automatic msgid/pot generation with i18ndude,
    module-info-header support and config-file support, CMFMember support 
    and several other little fixes and features.

  Fabiano Weimar dos Santos (xiru)

    Fabiano brought in some good ideas from his project (UML2AT). He
    did lots of testing and bug fixing and more bugfixing. Fabiano is
    our workflow hero: He wrote several code generation improvements
    for workflow definition.
